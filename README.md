# SystemAnalysisDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass project asked to create an online system for Liam and Ian at DriverPass. They needed a solution to help students prepare for driving tests with online classes, practice exams, and a reservation system.

What did you do particularly well?
  I clearly outlined the system’s features and requirements. Everything from the functional needs to the performance expectations were clearly defined, which will help guide the design and implementation phases.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could I would revise the security requirements section first. I’d include more details on handling different types of security threats and clarify the steps for account recovery to ensure comprehensive protection.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I focused on what the users really needed, like online access, scheduling, and progress tracking. It’s important to consider these needs to make sure the system is useful and easy to use so that it fits their actual needs.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I start by gathering detailed requirements and setting clear goals. In the future, I’d use user feedback and iterative design to continuously improve the system and make sure it meets user needs effectively
